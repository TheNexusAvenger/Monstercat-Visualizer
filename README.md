# Monstercat Visualizer
Runs the Monstercat style visualizer (2013-) using JavaScript. No external libraries like JQuery are used.

## Limited Music Selection
This version was made as a public demo. The version on my computer is directly tied into my file system. The version here has 50 random songs, some with and without backgrounds, for demo purposes. All metadata has been stripped from them.

## Viewing In Chrome/Edge:
The visuailzer can be used here: https://rawgit.com/TheNexusAvenger/Monstercat-Visualizer/master/index.html
Note: Chrome and Edge are the only browsers that work as intended. Internet Explorer doens't have the needed sound API to work at all.
